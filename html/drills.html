        <h3 class="instruction">One Minute Changes</h3>
        <p>Pick two chords, or a progression of chords. When you press start, a 1 minute timer begins. Your goal is to
            play as many clean chord changes as you can in that time span. One "chord change" should count as when you
            land on the original chord. If you have two chords, A and B, one change is A B A. Aim for 25-30 changes (for
            two chords), or whenever you can change cleanly without thinking about it.</p>
